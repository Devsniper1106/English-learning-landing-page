## Overview

My goal in this project was to practice the CSS I had recently leanred in an online course, in the context of  React and Styled Components. This felt like a logical next step from my [last project](https://github.com/BhandarkarPawan/product-preview-card-component), which was built purely using HTML and CSS. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

The biggest challenege I faced was learning how to make the image responsive on all screen sizes, while also avoiding overlap with the header. I ended up using the `<picture>` component with sources that get resolved based on the screen size. 

This code can be found in [Image.js](./src/components/Image/Image.js)

### Continued development
I am always looking for feedback on how to improve~

### Useful resources

- [Changing Image src based on window size](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30460681/changing-image-src-depending-on-screen-size) - This helped me avoid using multiple `img` tags. At first, I was using `display:none` and `display:block` based on the media queries. This helped me simplify things.
